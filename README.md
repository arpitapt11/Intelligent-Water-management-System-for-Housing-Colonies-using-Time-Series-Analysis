# Intelligent-Water-management-System-for-Housing-Colonies-using-Time-Series-Analysis

Water System depends on distribution systems to provide an uninterrupted supply of pressurized safe drinking water to all consumers. In big housing colonies like Apartment and so, management of water is a big challenge where water is distributed from main overhead tank to different apartments/houses in a complex or community.
The biggest challenge in such system is pumping the water from main tank to tanks for every house/apartment which is manually controlled or need to be managed by appropriate personnel. The control of the motor and maintenance lies with the appropriate personnel which poses lot of challenges. 
In addition, management of water usage need to be monitored for a particular community or complex for accordingly pumping the appropriate water which could result in proper conservation of water.

This project, serves a solution to the mentioned problem statement, by automating the process of Water transfer from a main overhead tank to individual tanks of houses in a colony and by predicting the requirement of each house in terms of Water consumption based upon theri tredn of using waterin the past.

This project integrates the following technologies to meet the desired objective:
1. Internet of Things
2. Machine Learning- Time Series Analysis 
3. Embedded Systems and Controls
4. Cloud Infrastructure
5. Mobile App Development

ARIMA algorithm under Time Series Analysis is being used as it does not require huge volume of data for predictive purpose (training).
Mobile app development, is the functionality of this system which is more on a futuristc perspective and would be developed later.
